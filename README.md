### Project Description
Zootopia" is a fun, interactive web portal where users can choose their spirit animal‚Äîcow, cat, dog, or monkey‚Äîeach leading to a unique voice-based translator experience. The homepage features animated animal icons, playful UI elements, and engaging visuals that invite users into a whimsical world where animals 'speak' back through custom web pages.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People often talk to animals for fun, but animals never respond. There‚Äôs no way to hear a funny or cute reply. This project makes it possible for users to speak and get a playful sound response from their chosen animal.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Zootopia lets you talk to animals‚Ä¶ well, kind of. It‚Äôs a one-way voice translator where you speak, and your chosen animal responds with its signature sound ‚Äî moo, bark, meow, or screech. No real communication, but maximum entertainment. It's the perfect mix of chaos, cuteness, and absolutely unnecessary innovation.
