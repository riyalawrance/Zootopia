### Project Description
Zootopia" is a fun, interactive web portal where users can choose their spirit animal‚Äîcow, cat, dog, or monkey‚Äîeach leading to a unique voice-based translator experience. The homepage features animated animal icons, playful UI elements, and engaging visuals that invite users into a whimsical world where animals 'speak' back through custom web pages.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
People often talk to animals for fun, but animals never respond. There‚Äôs no way to hear a funny or cute reply. This project makes it possible for users to speak and get a playful sound response from their chosen animal.
