### Project Description
Zootopia" is a fun, interactive web portal where users can choose their spirit animal—cow, cat, dog, or monkey—each leading to a unique voice-based translator experience. The homepage features animated animal icons, playful UI elements, and engaging visuals that invite users into a whimsical world where animals 'speak' back through custom web pages.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People often talk to animals for fun, but animals never respond. There’s no way to hear a funny or cute reply. This project makes it possible for users to speak and get a playful sound response from their chosen animal.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Zootopia lets you talk to animals… well, kind of. It’s a one-way voice translator where you speak, and your chosen animal responds with its signature sound — moo, bark, meow, or screech. No real communication, but maximum entertainment. It's the perfect mix of chaos, cuteness, and absolutely unnecessary innovation.
